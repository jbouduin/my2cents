# My2Cents
[My2Cents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_two_cents) is an embeddable commenting system written in JavaScript.

*My2Cents* is Licensed under the EUPL-1.2-or-later.

## This is still a work in progress
This means that a lot of the features have not been tested.

## Features:
- **Tiny**: it takes only ~**14 KB!!!** to embed My2Cents.
- **Open source** and **self-hosted**.
- **Ad-free**: *My2Cents* will not disturb your users.
- **Tracking-free**
- **Multiple databases supported**: SQLite3, Postgres and MySQL databases
- **Moderation**: with a *minimal* and *slick UI* a site administrator can allow/reject comments or trust/block users.
- **Notifications**: as a site owner, you can get notified about new comments awaiting moderation.
  - [webpush protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-protocol-12)
  - slack
  - mail
  - pushover
- **Third party providers for authentication**: users are not required to register a new account and you don't need to manage a user management system or bother about GDPR.

## Why I started building my2cents
I was looking for an embeddable commenting solution with the features described above for [my blog](https://agile-is-a-state-of-mind), and found [Schnack](https://schnack.cool/). Unfortunately, it only offers support for SQLite, a personal no-go for production environments.

As a non JavaScript developer I found no better solution then trying to port schnackjs to Typescript and implement other database connections myself. I tried to stick to the original implementation, until I realized that the original solution severely suffered from Cross-site issues. So in the end My2Cents became a completely different product.

BTW: I am pretty new to TS, so don't expect this to be the best code you ever saw. Please let me know, if you find code issues by [creating the appropriate issue](https://github.com/jbouduin/my2cents/issues). I'm eager to learn.

### Quickstart

This is the fastest way to setup *My2Cents* on your local workstation and give it a try.

**Requirements**:
- Node.js (>= v6)
- npm (>= v5)
- [Optional] git

Clone (if you have git) or download My2Cents from Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbouduin/my2cents
```

Go to the My2Cents directory:
```bash
cd my2cents
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the *My2Cents server*:
```bash
npm run dev
```

In another terminal window, in the my2cents directory, run the *Test web server*:
```bash
npm run start-hosting-server
```

You can now browse to http://localhost:8080.

### Who is using My2Cents?

My2Cents will never track who is using it, so I don't know! If you are a My2Cents user, [let me know](https://twitter.com/agile_state) and I'll add your website here. So far My2Cents is being used on:
